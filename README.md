Chief Complaint (CC)

History Of Present Illness (HPI)

  Screening : In case clinical index of suspicion for mental health disturbance is
  /high/ (subjective), patients are clinically screened for depression
  by asking the following set of questions:

  1/

      S leep : either increased or decreased sleep
      I nterest :
      G uilt : worthlessness, hopelessness, regret
      E nergy : deficit
      C oncentration : deficit
      A ppetite : either increased or descreased
      P sychomotor : either retardation or agitation
      S uicidality: As per the AAFP (5):


  SUICIDAL IDEATION
  The most effective approach for assessing suicidal ideation is to ask first about passive suicidal ideation. This sensitive area may be introduced with the question, “With all the depression you've been dealing with, have you ever had the thought that you'd be better off dead?” The most common response is the reassuring, “Oh sure, the thought has crossed my mind, but I'd never do anything to hurt myself.” However, if active suicidal ideation is present, one should determine if the patient has a suicide plan in place and estimate how realistic and imminent it is. A patient with a specific suicide plan should undergo urgent psychiatric evaluation.

  As we talked about a bit, there are several screening methods in use, including
  use of the PHQ-9 questionnaire.

Past Medical History (PMH)

Past Surgical History (PSH)

Past Psychiatric History (PPH)

  2/ Have you previously received a mental health diagnosis?
  3/ Have you ever been prescribed any medications for your mental health?
  4/ Have you ever previously seen a mental health professional?

Medications / Allergies (M/A)

  1/ as above in PPH : Have you ever been prescribed any medications for your mental health?

Social History (SH)

  1/ Q : When was the first time you noticed that something was wrong/different?
  2/ Q : Do you have family or friends you are able to talk with about this?
  3/ Q : Would you like help finding someone to talk with further about this?
